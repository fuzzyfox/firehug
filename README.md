How to run:

    cp local.json-dist local.json
    npm install
    npm install -g bower
    npm install -g grunt
    grunt

Install a local Redis server and start it before using `grunt`. Open an issue if you need API keys for `local.json`. The application won't start if you don't have these keys or the Redis server is missing.
